php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

# Load fixtures (optional - for test data)
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

⚠️ **Important**: Ensure your MongoDB service is running before proceeding.

### 5️⃣ Start the development server

**Using Symfony CLI** *(recommended)*:
```bash
symfony server:start
```

**Or using PHP's built-in server**:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
